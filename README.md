**Intro**
This project is called "Around The U.S." This is a website for explorers to post their photos of their adventures, like other users photos and add each other to interact with other explorers.

**Technologies Utilized**
In this project I utilized the following technologies:
-VSCODE
IDE I prefer to utilize for code writing
-HTML
Used to create the basic structure of the webpage and organized via BEM style
-CSS
Used to define the specific styles for the webpage and also to make the webpage responsive for the webpage to function according to the user's device.
-Github
To deloy my code and hold the working and completed project from VScode
-Figma
Provided an overview of the webpage design and the specifications needed for this project

**Ideas For Improvement**
I think this project could be improved by adding a feature for users to customize the way their profile looks and also creating a design for this webpage that is more fitting for what the use is. It's about social connection between outdoor adventures and the deisgn right now is very black, industrial, boring and unwelcoming to use. I would improve this by putting thought into the design of the webpage based on it's purpose and the types of users it's trying to appeal to.
